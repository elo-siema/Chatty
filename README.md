# Chatty

Chatty is a chat web application built with Node.js, jQuery, Socket.io and Express.js.

It still lacks some functionalities I planned for it to have.

There's code for both front and back-end.

#
The project was made for educational purposes.
It's based on the guide by Socket.io @ https://socket.io/get-started/chat/

I believe I could have fucked something up.
Ongoing fixes.
